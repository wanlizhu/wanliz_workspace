vulkan: Add image load/store support for D16 and D32

This was a request from Valve and it aligns with our DX12 implementation. Our SULD/SUST operations don't support depth formats directly, so we program the image header with the equivalent R16u/R32f formats.

CTS is pending here: https://gerrit.khronos.org/c/vk-gl-cts/+/14669
